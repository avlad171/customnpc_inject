# This is a (core)mod that injects a function into minecraft code (WIP)

Right now it adds some methods to noppes.npc.scripted.ScriptWorld so you can call them from a customnpc script. You end up with npcs shooting lasers :)

To build (it only runs in obfuscated environment aka you start minecraft w/ launcher, not from eclipse):

"gradlew build"

Game version: 1.7.10
You need customnpcs and techguns for this mod to work
