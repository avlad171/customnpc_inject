# This is a (core)mod that injects a function into minecraft code (WIP)

Right now it add a method "target" to net.minecraft.world.World so you can call it from a customnpc script.
The function call the method from techguns that fires the laser beam. You end up with npcs shooting lasers :)

To build: (it only runs in obfuscated environment)

"gradlew build"

Game version: 1.7.10
You need customnpcs and techguns for this mod to work
